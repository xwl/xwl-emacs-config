;;; Commentary:

;; There has been a tendency among Scheme teachers to use brackets at
;; some places in the Scheme syntax to help newcomers to read the
;; language. Some experienced Scheme users claim that this makes code
;; less readable, and I agree. If you do, too, this mode will protect
;; you from the malicious bracket invasion.

;; See http://www.forcix.cx/weblog/2006-05-07.html for a longer
;; explanation.

;; To use, simply M-x bracketphobia in a file with brackets, or add
;; `bracketphobia-auto' to your `find-file-hook'.

;; There's also M-x bracketphobia-hide, but that is only usable for
;; viewing, and I haven't found out how to turn it off yet :-)
