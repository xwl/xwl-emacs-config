;;; auto-enca.el --- automatically detect coding system with Enca

;; This code is public domain. Use it as is, at your own risk.
;; I tried it with Emacs 22, and it seems that it gives quite
;; satisfying results, but YMMV.
;;
;; The following function, enca-detect-coding, is meant to be placed at
;; file-coding-system-alist in order to detect coding system of files
;; when they are opened. This happens by running Enca on the file.
;;
;; Enca (Extremely Naive Charset Analyser) can be found at the address
;; http://trific.ath.cx/Ftp/enca/
;;
;; To get this function working, put the file at some place in your
;; load-path, compile, and add something like this into .emacs:
;;
;; (when (load "auto-enca" 'noerror)
;;   (modify-coding-system-alist 'file "" 'enca-detect-coding))
;;
;; With thanks to Kenichi Handa for nice suggestions.
